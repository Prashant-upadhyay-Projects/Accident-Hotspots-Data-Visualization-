## 🔹 Project Highlights  

### 🚦 Accident Hotspots Analysis  
- Identified **4 major hotspots** using geospatial visualizations  
- Observed a surge in accidents between **July–November**  

---

### 🌦️ Weather Conditions & Accidents  
- Weather condition **“D”** dominated during accident-heavy months  
- Performed **cluster analysis** to validate correlation with higher accident frequency  
- Used **pattern recognition techniques** for validation  

---

### 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Identifying Possible Insurance Clients  
- Filtered uninsured individuals involved in accidents  
- Proposed **targeted marketing opportunities** for insurance providers  
- Example: Uninsured drivers in **Rotterdam hotspot during July–October**  

---

### 📊 Executive Insights  
- **Strong seasonal and weather-driven accident trends** identified  
- **Cluster analysis validated hypothesis**: Weather “D” → increased accidents  
- **Business impact**: Targeting uninsured individuals = potential client acquisition strategy
